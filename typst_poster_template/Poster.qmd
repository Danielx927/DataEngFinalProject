# Introduction

Singapore’s Certificate of Entitlement (COE) system was established in 1990 to regulate vehicle ownership by requiring individuals to bid for limited certificates valid for 10 years. COE premiums fluctuate in response to changing market dynamics—particularly the available quota and demand from consumers.

This poster examines how COE prices have evolved in relation to the quota supply across various vehicle categories. By analysing both price trends and supply volumes, we uncover patterns that reveal how tight quotas can drive up premiums, and vice versa. Understanding this relationship provides valuable insight into market behavior and informs future transport and policy planning.

| ------------- | ------------------------- |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1             | Clear Trend Lines         | Colour-coded lines for each COE category clearly show long-term trends across time.                             |
| 2             | Endpoint Labels           | Annotated end values (e.g., Cat B: S\$135,336) help highlight latest prices without hovering.                   |
| 3             | Clean Design              | Minimalist styling focuses attention on the data without distractions.                                          |
| 4             | Interactive Exploration   | Hover and filter by category and year to uncover meaningful patterns hidden in the data.                        |



# Suggested Improvements
| *Index*       | *Improvement*             | *Elaboration*                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1             | X-Axis Granularity        | Allow X-axis to show bi-monthly bidding exercise instead of just showing years in quaters.                      |
| 2             | Category Clarification    | Include more descriptive labels or tooltips (e.g., “Cat A: Small cars ≤1600cc or ≤97kW”) for better context.    |
| 3             | Policy/Economic Context   | Overlay annotations for major events (e.g., COVID-19, Quota injections) to explain price shifts.                |
| 4             | Category D Visibility     | Allow category filtering or log scale of y-axis to highlight Cat D, which has much lower prices.                |
| 5             | Supply Context            | Show the relationship of quota suppy to quota premium prices.                                                   |

3.Cross-Checked with data from [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/datasets/d_69b3380ad7e51aff3a7dcc84eba52b8a/view).

## Data Cleaning:
  1. Renamed **Category** (e.g.`"Cat A: ≤1600cc or ≤97kW"`); dropped **Cat E (Open)** as it mimics **Cat B**.
  2. Simplified **Bidding Exercise** to `"1"` or `"2"`; extracted **Month** from **Announcement Date**, normalised to 3-letter format (e.g., `"Sep"` not `"Sept"`).  
  3. Standardised column names (lowercase, underscores); ensured correct types (e.g., **Quota** as integer).

## Libraries and Tools Used: 
1. **Data Handling**: `dplyr`, `tidyverse`, `lubridate`, `stringr`, `readxl`  
2. **Tables**: `knitr`, `DT` (for formatted and interactive tables)  
3. **Visualisation**: `plotly` (for interactive charts)  
4. **HTML Styling**: `htmltools` (custom styling and layout tweaks)  
5. **Document Output**: Quarto (PDF via Typst poster layout)

# Insight

::: {.callout-warning title="1. Feast and Famine: COE Prices and Quota Supply"}
- *Feast and Famine cycle* can be seen every **10 years** where 10-year COE expires, injecting new supply into the market.
- COE prices tend to **rise sharply** when quotas are low, and **drop significantly** when quotas are high.
- *Clear signal of supply-demand dynamics at play in the COE system.*
- **Quota increases** in late 2023 caused **temporary dips** in COE prices.
:::

::: {.callout-warning title="2. Luxury Segment (Cat B) Is Most Sensitive to Quota Fluctuations"}
- **Cat B** shows the **highest volatility** in price relative to supply.
- Strong demand persists even when quotas shrink.
- *Buyers of larger vehicles may be less price-sensitive—indicating inelastic demand.*
:::

::: {.callout-warning title="3. Prices Anticipate or Lag Behind Quota Changes"}
- Price hikes often **precede quota reductions** or **linger** after supply rebounds.
- Suggests **speculative or expectation-driven bidding**.
- *Market behavior is shaped not only by current supply but future outlook and sentiment.*

# Further suggestions

An enhancements that can help boost this visualisation's analytical power and strategic value is adding a moving average in the form of **Prevailing Quota Premium (PQP)**. This would provide a clearer view of the underlying trends in COE prices, smoothing out short-term fluctuations and making it easier to identify long-term patterns.
