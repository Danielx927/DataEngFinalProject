# Introduction

Singapore’s Certificate of Entitlement (COE) system, introduced in 1990, controls vehicle ownership through a bidding process for limited 10-year certificates. COE prices are influenced by demand, quotas, and economic trends.
To better understand the real cost burden on consumers, this study integrates Consumer Price Index (CPI) data to adjust COE premiums for inflation. By comparing nominal COE prices with their inflation-adjusted counterparts, we gain insights into how the true purchasing power required for car ownership has evolved. This dual perspective allows for a more accurate assessment of long-term affordability and the impact of macroeconomic conditions on the vehicle market.

| ------------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1             | X-Axis Granularity        | Allow X-axis to show bi-monthly bidding exercise instead of just showing years in quaters.                      |
| 2             | Category Clarification    | Include descriptive labels or tooltips (e.g., “Cat A: Small cars ≤1600cc or ≤97kW”) for better context.         |
| 3             | Policy/Economic Context   | Overlay annotations for major events (e.g., COVID-19, Quota injections) to explain price shifts.                |
| 4             | Category D Visibility     | Allow category filtering or log scale of y-axis to highlight Cat D, which has much lower prices.                |
| 5             | Inflation Context         | Add additional CPI date to inflation with current COE prices.                                                   |
| 6             | Interactivity             | Add chart to be dynamic and scaled according to filter of chart elements to allow for better visual comparisons.|

## Data Source:
### COE Data Columns

| `Category`                 | COE category (e.g., Cat A, Cat B)                                                |

## Data Cleaning:
The following transformations were applied to prepare the dataset:
  1. Renamed **Category** (e.g., to `"Cat A: ≤1600cc or ≤97kW"`); dropped **Cat E (Open)** for being too volatile.  
  2. Simplified **Bidding Exercise** to `"1"` or `"2"`; extracted **Month** from **Announcement Date**, normalized to 3-letter format (e.g., `"Sep"` not `"Sept"`).  
  3. Transposed **CPI** data; extracted **Year** and **Month** from `data_series`.  
  4. Merged **COE** and **CPI** on **Year** and **Month**; computed inflation-adjusted premiums.  
  5. Standardized column names (lowercase, underscores); ensured correct types (e.g., **Quota** as integer).

## Libraries and Tools Used: 
- **Data Handling**: `dplyr`, `tidyverse`, `lubridate`, `stringr`, `readxl`  
- **Tables**: `knitr`, `DT` (for formatted and interactive tables)  
- **Visualisation**: `plotly` (for interactive charts)  
- **HTML Styling**: `htmltools` (custom styling and layout tweaks)  
- **Document Output**: Quarto (PDF via Typst poster layout)

# Insight

::: {.callout-warning title="1. Real COE Premiums Show Slower Growth"}
- **Nominal COE prices** rose sharply post-2021.
- **Real (inflation-adjusted) prices** show a more moderate trend.
- *Perceived cost increase is partly inflation-driven; real burden is more stable.*
:::

::: {.callout-warning title="2. Cat B Bears the Greatest Burden"}
- Cat B consistently has the **highest premiums** in both nominal and real terms.
- Steep increases observed from **2021 to 2023**.
- *Larger vehicle buyers face the biggest real cost squeeze—likely due to demand or limited quota.*
:::

::: {.callout-warning title="3. Inflation Gap Is Widening Recently"}
- The **gap between nominal and real prices** has increased since 2022.
- Nominal values diverge significantly from adjusted values.
- *Inflation increasingly distorts affordability—real purchasing power is declining.*

# Further suggestions

Some enhancements that can elevate this visualisation's analytical power and strategic value:

1. **Statistical trend lines or COE 3M-PQP** would help users identify underlying patterns and policy impacts more clearly, particularly during complex periods like 2008–2015 where long-term trends could be distinguished from short-term market volatility.

2. **Comparative affordability metrics** such as COE-to-median-income ratios would add crucial economic context, helping users understand price movements in relation to broader economic conditions and purchasing power.
